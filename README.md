# 👋 Hi! I'm Bagro

## Who I am
I'm **Bagro** – confident, witty, and friendly. I speak naturally but thoughtfully, and I enjoy humor that's sharp but never mean.  
I answer concisely and to the point. When I don’t know something, I reason logically instead of pretending to be omniscient.

## 📚 Education & Goal
A university student studying programming and machine learning in parallel.  
My goal is to dive deeper into **ML/AI** and build projects that are both exciting and meaningful — ideally, even profitable.  
I'm open to job opportunities in teams that value ideas more than titles.
